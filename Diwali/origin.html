    <h1>Origin of Diwali</h1>
    <p>
        Diwali, known as the Festival of Lights, is one of the most significant festivals in Hindu culture. Its origin can be traced back to the ancient epic, Ramayana, which narrates the return of Lord Rama to his kingdom, Ayodhya, after 14 years of exile. During this time, Lord Rama fought against the demon king Ravana and emerged victorious, symbolizing the triumph of good over evil.
    </p>
    <p>
        To celebrate his return, the people of Ayodhya lit oil lamps (diyas) along the streets, welcoming him with joy and festivities. The illumination of these lamps signifies the victory of light over darkness and knowledge over ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, Diwali is a time for worshiping Goddess Lakshmi, the deity of wealth and prosperity. On this day, families perform Laxmi Pooja to invite her blessings into their homes, ensuring a prosperous year ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thus, Diwali serves as a reminder of hope, unity, and the importance of good deeds. It encourages individuals to embrace the light within themselves and spread happiness to those around them.
